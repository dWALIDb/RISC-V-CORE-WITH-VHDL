# RISC V
RISC V is an open Instruction Set Architecture used for the developement of custom processors.  
It is the **fifth** generation of developement hence, the V (in risv-V).  
The architecture is well documented by the RISC V organization, where the ISA is discussed.  
It has a base instruction set named RV32I containing all instructions necessary for a fully fledged cental processing unit. It still
offers other extensions for more implementations depending on the manufacturers,
